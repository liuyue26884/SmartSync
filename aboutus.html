            our glasses experiences a newfound confidence in their vision and appearance.</h4>

            accessible to all. With a commitment to innovation and a focus on customer
            satisfaction, we continually push the boundaries of eyewear technology,

            <h1>Company Background</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
        <h4>It all started with the opening of the very first TCCJY store in Subang,Selamgor
            ,back in 2005.At the time, it simply called Focus Glasses and the store was
            nothing more than a small counter in a shopping centre.</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>From those humble beginnings, we have grown from a small-town optical store
            to a company that not only leads the eyewear retail industry in the country,
            but one that is set to make its mark on the region.</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>Following the establishment of TCCJY Sdn Bhd in 2008,
            a head office was set up in Subang, Selangor to provide management and
            operational support to the growing number of retail branches. But more
            opportunities beckoned, and we eventually expanded to the nation's capital,
            Kuala Lumpur in 2010.</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>At the same time, we are also embracing a knowledge-based economy where
            innovation and technology are essential in adding to our value, enhancing
            our professional services, and boosting our overall competitiveness.
            TCCJY is also the first in the optical market to have embarked on
            eCommerce with the aim of building online to offline shopping experiences
            for customers.</h4>
